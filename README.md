## Who are we?
A Star is a professional development platform by students, for students. Our goal is to close the diversity hiring gap by providing underrepresented computer science students with the tools they need to become **qualified** Software Engineers. 

With personalized learning pathways to track progress, students can hone in on their technical skills while providing recruiters with a data-driven talent pool of diverse candidates.

## What we think the problem could be

- [ ]  Too many other tasks recruiters have to focus on
- [ ]  Unknown ambitious candidate information
- [ ]  Not enough time to find quality engineers
- [ ]  Gap in technical experience and expectations
